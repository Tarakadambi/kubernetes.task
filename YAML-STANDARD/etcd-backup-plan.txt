# ETCD Backup Plan â€“ Kubernetes Microservices Deployment (Streaming Platform)

As I do not have SSH or administrative access to the K3s server, I am unable to execute the ETCD backup directly.

However, if access were granted, the following command would be used to perform an ETCD backup:

    k3s etcd-snapshot save --name etcd-backup

This would generate a snapshot file in the following path on the K3s master node:

    /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/db/snapshots/

The snapshot file would then be retrieved using SCP or another secure file transfer method.

    scp user@<k3s-host>:/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/db/snapshots/etcd-backup-<timestamp>.zip .

This backup ensures recovery of cluster state in the event of node failure or misconfiguration.
